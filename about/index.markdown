I feel like I've always been a programmer. I enjoy books, taking my kids on bike rides, chocolate, dogs, those little notebooks you carry around with you, photography, a good weekend hack, traveling, writing, food, craftsmanship, a great pen, Markdown, music, movies, and talking to amazing people.

You can find me on Twitter as [@benstraub](https://twitter.com/benstraub), and on GitHub as [@ben](https://github.com/ben).
