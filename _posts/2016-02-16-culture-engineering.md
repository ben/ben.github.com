One of the biggest points I make in my [talk about chat bots](talks/robots/) is that *culture is hackable* — you can change your team or company culture by writing code.

This isn't a Great Insight™.
Architecture is on some level the study of how buildings and spaces affect human behavior.
Seemingly minor advances in weapons technology have completely changed the way war is waged, and a [better way of putting words on paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) changed the entire course of civilization.
Life imitates technology.

This was definitely front-of-mind when I worked for GitHub, where the main product wasn't just a place to put your code, but a particular workflow for which that tool was crafted.
We knew, deep down, that the thing we were making was stimulating teams to have a certain kind of culture.
The internal tools we made and used were often explicitly designed to affect culture in specific ways.
We're also thinking about this at [my current job](http://gridium.com), as we build a communication tool for property managers, and we've hacked on our own culture, using tools like [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com) and [high-fives](https://github.com/ben/hubot-tangocard-highfive).

The word "hacking" has been misused for many purposes over the years, but I usually take it to mean "getting the quickest possible result from a system, without much regard to long-term or side effects."
This is in contrast to *engineering*, which actually has a formal definition, but which I think of as "creating a system in a planned and controlled way, with thought given to long-term sustainability and side effects."
Neither of these approaches is right or wrong, they're just appropriate for different projects.
You wouldn't hack together a passenger jet with trial and error, and you wouldn't run risk analyses before you made a paper airplane.

I still like to think of myself as a culture hacker, and I still plan on looking for low-hanging fruit in the intersection of software and human societies.
But I want to spend more time thinking about how we would build larger systems, with more intentionality.
How do we **engineer** our culture?
