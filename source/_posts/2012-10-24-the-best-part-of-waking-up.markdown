It seems like such a small detail: what's the first thing you do when you wake
up?  Hop in the shower?  Check your email?  Hit Reddit for a [quick puppy
fix][3] before the coffee starts working?

I recently switched to writing code.

## Setting the tone

You wake up each day completely fresh.  It takes a while before all the worries
from yesterday make themselves known again, so for a while you have an empty,
clear mind.  And the first thing you put in is going to stick.

I used to read email, Twitter, and Facebook first thing in the morning.  That
got me current with what happened while I was asleep, but it put me in the
mindset of keeping up.  *Following*.  From that point on, I had to know what
was going on, and since people are constantly doing things, I was always
behind.  I hate being behind.

## Mindset

The write-first strategy puts you in the maker's mindset.  You've made things
all day, you've been fixing bugs since before breakfast.

A read-first morning puts you in the mindset of a consumer.  You're looking to
*be* entertained, always out for that next endorphin hit.  Not only does this
reduce your output, it [kills your creativity][1].

I've found that some of my best ideas come to me in the shower, but there needs
to be something I'm working on in that part of my mind that lurks just behind
the conscious.  If that something is "I wonder what [Gruber][2] is thinking
about," I'm missing a great opportunity.  I'd much rather be solving problems.
Besides, the answer is always "Apple, or maybe baseball."

## The Power of Habit

We like to think of ourselves as sentient beings with free will.  This is
a pleasant fiction, with many practical benefits, but as any psychologiest will
tell you, it's not exactly true.  On any given day, it's likely that a person
will do the same thing she did yesterday, as opposed to a completely new thing.
We're mammals, and habit is powerful.

What if your habits weren't harmful, like heroin, or merely benign, like
drinking coffee?  What if they were constructive, what if they actually made
you feel *better*?

It's been working.  I feel more like a maker if, before I do anything else,
I make something.  I start checking Twitter and Facebook as break time, rather
than using them to avoiding real work, and I get more real work done.

It's amazing what power a small detail can have.
