About a year ago, we bought a car.
A pretty nice car, as cars go: a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
It's a lovely car, it really is.
It gets my family from one place to another in safety and comfort, and it gets a staggering (for its size) 27MPG for us, so we're not spending a ton on diesel or ruining the planet too much.

But there are a couple of things that drive me batty.
I'd like to detail them here, just so I can stop thinking about them.

- Door locks
  - regular person grip doesn't work
  - have to poke at the button without wrapping your hand around
  - (photos)
- sound System
  - can't turn off, only mute
  - defaults to the first source that has signal
  - aside: hate radio
  - result: always noise when the car is turned on
  - sometimes falls back to AM
- usb
  - first try with usb: FAIL
  - have to install a crappy app
  - then plug in, half the time it doesn't work
  - do the plug-in-turn-on dance correctly, always plays itunes playlist in song-alpha order
  - aside: kid-friendly playlist for dinner and free time around the house
  - result: _always_ plays A.M. by One Direction when I plug my phone in
  - how hard would it be to just use the standard audio controls?
  - ton of latency, almost worse than bluetooth
- Overcast
  - playing a podcast, it ends, start another - DOESN'T WORK
  - playing a podcast, delete it, start another - DOESN'T WORK
- bluetooth
  - still always wants to hit play as soon as it can
  - PLUS: wife and kids picked me up
    - as soon as I came into pairing range, started playing the salty podcast I was listening to
- conclusions
  - whoever decided how this should work drives alone and hates silence

### Turning it on

### Plugging in Your Phone
