One of the biggest points I make in my [talk about chat bots](talks/robots/) is that **culture is hackable.**
A person can change their team's or company's culture by writing code.
You input keystrokes, and the output is changed human behavior.

This isn't a Great Insightâ„¢.
Anyone who makes tools knows this: when you build a thing for people to use, you affect how they do all the things around that thing.
The whole process is changed, even if just a little.
And when your tool is for communication, the most quintessentially human of activities, the process you're plugging into is culture.

A lot of people are aware of this effect, especially people who make tools.
This was definitely front-of-mind at GitHub, where the big product wasn't just a place to put your code, but also a finely tuned workflow.
We knew, deep down, that the thing we were making was stimulating teams to have a certain kind of culture.
This feeling was nowhere more apparent than in all the internal tools, like Team and Halp, which were designed to affect culture in specific ways.
We're definitely thinking about this at [Gridium](http://gridium.com), as we build a tool for property managers.
And we've hacked on our culture using technical tools, like [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com) and [high-fives](https://github.com/ben/hubot-tangocard-highfive).

The word "hacking" has been misused for many purposes over the years, but I always take it to mean "getting the quickest possible result from a system, without much regard to long-term or side effects."
This is in contrast to the word "engineering," which actually has a formal definition, but which I think of in contrast to hacking: "creating a system in a carefully planned and controlled way, with thought given to long-term sustainability and side effects."
Neither of these approaches is wrong or right, they're just different ways to approach solving a problem.
You wouldn't hack together a passenger jet with trial and error, and you wouldn't run risk analyses before you made a paper airplane.

I still like to think of myself as a culture hacker, and I still plan on looking for low-hanging fruit in the intersection of software and human societies.
But I want to spend more time thinking about how we would build larger systems, with more intentionality.
