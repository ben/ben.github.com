If you don't have kids this will sound trite, and if you do it will sound obvious: when my son was born, my life changed.

Before that, his mother I had a sort of balance to our lives.
We both spent most of our weekdays with coworkers, most of our evenings together, and some of our weekend time doing things around (but not necessarily *with*) each other.
We both got fulfillment at work, all the attention we needed from the other person in the relationship, and some measure of [third-place-ness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) or solitude.
There was effort involved in maintaining this balance, but it really wasn't that hard.
Almost easy.

Then Will came along.
This is a story as old as parenthood; suddenly the alone-time part of each day disappeared, as did most of our one-on-one time with each other.
I have no regret for having him, or his sister; helping them become themselves is one of the most rewarding and emotionally intense things I've ever done.
But his (and later, his sister's) urgent needs changed the balance.
We both still went to work, but evenings and weekends were swallowed up with bathing, changing, feeding, and paying attention to a baby.
The first and second places were still there, but the third one was put on hold.

Fast forward to a year ago.
I work from home, in an office I share with my wife.
The kids are 4 and 6, have their own after-school activity schedules, and need help with their homework.
The first and second places have become the same thing, all of the third-place time has been swallowed up, and there's no solitude in sight.

The balance is way off, and we're all feeling it.
All of our relationships are strained, because what little time we spend on them isn't enough.
One of the most important relationships a human has – the relationship with oneself – is getting no time at all.

### The Retreat

Becky came up with an ingenious solution to this.
Here are the rules:

1. Every six months, you get three nights *off* from being part of the family.
1. You are not allowed to feel guilty about this.

For my last retreat, I went to the Oregon coast with our dogs.
Apart from a few walks on the beach, I never left the house.
I enjoyed a blissful 12-hour-long hacking session, watched two action movies, and played a video game all the way through.
None of these things would have been possible if I were at home, but all of them were things I had been craving.
