# Adventure as a Family Tradition

One of the most common traits of happy families is having traditions.
Some families recite poetry over dinner; some cook together; some read aloud at bedtime every night, even to their teenagers.
Our family goes on adventures.

If there's one thing we've learned from being parents, it's that adventures come in all sizes.
On one end of the continuum are life's grand adventures.
Driving an RV halfway across the country for Thanksgiving.
Disneyland.
Hawaii.
These memorable experiences are the kind of thing you keep with you for a lifetime, and there's nothing that can really substitute for them.

On the other end of the spectrum are tiny adventures.
Finding the other shoe.
Running out of gas.
Opening a new board game.
Going to the grocery store.
This kind of adventure isn't as memorable, at least not on its own, but in sum total these little moments, and the way you attack them, add up to a large fraction of your life.

## We're Raising Adventurers

It all comes back to food, perhaps the smallest adventure of all.
If you're not willing to try that weird thing on your plate, how will you tackle life's bigger challenges?

Our family adopted a Paleo/Primal diet four years ago, when Will and Lucy were 2 and 4.
Most of our friends and family thought we were crazy, and those who were parents insisted that their kids would *never* go for it.
Here's the secret: **ours didn't either.**
But we had some help from the a-word.

We told them that this was an adventure for their mouth.
That their taste buds were going into uncharted territory, that they'd be blazing a trail through vines (sprouts) and trees (broccoli), and defending themselves against ravenous wild boar (andouille sausage).
And, when all of that stopped working, we told them that this is what our family was having for dinner, and if they didn't like it, they didn't have to eat it.
Oh, and if you finish, there's a dessert course.

It worked, and it's still working for us.
We're the family that goes to a potluck, and our kids ask for more of the roasted vegetables and Brussels sprouts.
(Usually we're the ones who brought them, and we make sure they're delicious, but still.)
They've learned you'll discover *lots* of things you didn't even know you liked.

## Adventures Aren't Always Comfortable

They've also learned to deal with hardship.
Lucy doesn't like squash.
She never has, and she knows it.
But when it shows up in the ragu, she makes sure to take little bites of it with the bacon and sausage, so she doesn't end up with six hateful bites before she gets dessert.

Will doesn't like getting wet.
He'll ask me to open his car door on rainy days so his hands stay dry.
But when he packs for outdoor school in the dead of winter, he just grits his teeth and packs his rain gear.

Because we've taught them that **fun and misery aren't opposites.**
In fact, some of the most fun moments are the ones you'd think are the worst possible.
You may not recognize them until years later, but they'll be there, because discomfort is memorable.


## Don't Adventure Alone

Nobody ever made it to the top of Mt. Everest on their own, and our adventures are no different.
There are businesses and organizations in your community that can help you, and we want to give a shout out to the ones that have helped us.

## Our Family Tradition

We've made a commitment, all four of us, to doing what it takes to make this life worthwhile.
And so not only do we relish the adventures we plan, meticulously, [a year in advance](http://100.straub.cc/), but we also keep a careful eye out for journeys we didn't know we were on until we had taken the first step.
