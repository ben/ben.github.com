      <h4>The Book on Git</h4>
      <div class="description">
        <p>This is effectively "the book" on Git, and I was honored and excited
           when Scott asked me to co-author the second edition. It's now even
           better than it was when I read it as a younger engineer, and the
           ability to help developers new and old become better at their craft is
           a source of pride.</p>

      <h4>Little company, big impact</h4>
      <div class="date">2014 â€“ Present</div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>The opportunity to work with an energy startup was very attractive to me,
           and since I've never worked at a company in this stage of its history,
           I felt like I had to work here.</p>
        <p>I've found that being part of such a small team has some major advantages,
           among which is the ability to shape the culture. I'm helping to build the
           kind of company I want to work for.</p>
        <p>I've been working on all parts of the web-application stack, from data storage
           to API design to Ember-backed front-end work. I've also done some culture
           hacking with Hubot, which has resulted in some open-source plugins.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a></h3>
      <h4>The Big Show</h4>
      <div class="date">2012 - 2014</div>
      <div class="description">
         <p>This was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. GitHub had been on my
            "I-need-to-work-here" list since about 2009, and when I was offered a job,
            I jumped at it.</p>
         <p>This was where I found out what it is to be a part of the Internet in a
            real way. I traveled the world, speaking at conferences. I worked with
            my personal heroes. I learned what it was to help make a company. This
            was truly the big time.</p>
         <p>My main focus was libgit2, an implementation of git with
            a nice API and no dependencies on a UNIX environment. This led me to helping
            out with back-end systems, mainline git, and even the native clients
            (GitHub for Windows and Mac). I helped run an open-source project,
            wrote its documentation, and found out how I work best.</p>

      <h4>Don't call it a comeback</h4>
      <div class="date">2011 - 2012</div>
      <div class="description">
         <p>In 2010, I suffered a major personal setback.  I needed a change
            of pace, new scenery, and different technology.  I switched to an
            iPhone, moved to Portland, and took a job downtown.</p>
         <p>Here I learned the importance of fearlessness.  The code had a
            decent set of unit tests, and I had my very own copy of Resharper.
            There was no marketing safety net when making customer-facing
            product decisions.  It was terrifying and thrilling.</p>
         <p>I worked on a system that helps people sell things on the Internet.
            Sellers tell my code what kinds of things they have, and my code
            lists those items on eBay and Amazon (and a dozen others),
            and <em>figures out what price they should be.</em>  I led the
            charge to modernize the UX on a six-year-old WinForms codebase,
            and educated the entire team on the best way to do it.</p>

      <h4>Taking on the world</h4>
      <div class="date">2006 - 2011</div>
      <div class="description">
         <p>I decided I wanted to be in the Portland area.  Pickings were slim
            at the time, but when a position at <em>this</em> company came up,
            I had to take it.</p>
         <p>It was here that I learned practicality and self-doubt.  The
            coolest technology doesn't always fit your project.  The most
            elegant code isn't necessarily the best.  You can't rewrite the
            entire system every two weeks.</p>
         <p>I wrote drivers for USB/HID devices, and the connectors and
            services that make them sing.  Without the software I made, a
            tablet would be nothing but a fancy mousepad; with it, a user can
            kick some serious ass.  The system spans the chasm from kernel- to
            user-mode, from datastream processing to UI.  And it does it in 13
            languages.</p>

      <h4>Fresh-faced</h4>
      <div class="date">2003 - 2006</div>
      <div class="description">
         <p>This was my first job after college.  I wrote drivers and
            applications for Windows CE and (later) Windows Mobile, running on
            handheld barcode scanners.  That sounds quaint to modern-day
            smartphone owners, I know.
         <p>I got my start writing drivers, but I also discovered my passion
            for UI, for things that users would <em>see</em>.  I was
            reading <em>On Lisp</em>, I was writing to-do lists in Rails and
            sudoku for TabletPCs, and I was loving it.  It was here I learned
            to surround myself with smart people, and learn as much from them
            as I could.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <div class="item">
      <h3>Languages</h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p>I've been writing in C and C++ since high school, long enough to
           pass through the &ldquo;hate&rdquo; phase and back into
           &ldquo;respect.&rdquo; I've used the STL and boost, and have
           written enough template classes to know that it's usually best not
           to.</p>
        <p>I have decent chops with C#, SQL Server, Windows Forms and WPF.
           I've written and deployed Rack services to load-balanced EC2
           clusters.  I've connected with third-party APIs, like eBay's
           Selling API and Amazon MWS, and where these APIs fall short I've
           scraped.</p>
        <p>I've also written or debugged a fair amount of perl, python, ruby,
           java, and powershell.  I am familiar with Objective C, Lisp, and a
           bit of Haskell.  I came close to writing a parser for an installer
           script language, but settled for an Emacs syntax highlighter
           instead.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <h3>Platforms &amp; Tools</h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p>I've written for many flavors of Windows (even CE), and I've been
           in both user-mode and kernel-mode.  I know the registry and the
           device manager; the shell namespace and the GAC.</p>
        <p>I'm also an iPhone-carrying Apple fan.  I own one of the first Intel
           MacBooks to roll off the line, and I still love it.  I know what
           a <code>plist</code> is, and I know how <code>.app</code> bundles
           work.</p>
        <p>I've worked in mixed Windows/OSX/Linux environment for five years,
           so I know where <code>bash</code> and <code>psh</code> disagree,
           and how to get Capistrano running on Windows.  I've architected a
           lot of features in that environment, and I've learned how and when
           to share code.</p>
        <p>I know the other stuff too.  I have a favorite source control tool.
           I have opinions on defect tracking.  I know the difference between
           UCS-2 and UTF-16.  And I'd love to debate agile versus Agile.

      <h3>My Secret Weapon</h3>
      <div class="description">
        <p>I love to learn.  Especially when it comes to technology.</p>
        <p>Give me two weeks and a good book, and I'll help you find bugs in
           an iOS app, and <em>I'll be happy doing it.</em>  Scala?  Sounds
           like fun.  COBOL?  Well, we all have our limits.</p>
        <p>This is what I bring.  I'm great at staying up to date, bringing in
           fresh ideas, and trying new things.</p>
