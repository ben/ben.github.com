                <p class="resume-item-copy">
                    I've found that being part of such a small team has some major advantages, among which is the ability to shape the culture and technological substrate. I'm helping to build the kind of company I want to work for. Working on a software system at the beginning of its life gave me the opportunity to apply all the lessons I've learned from working on more mature applications. I've taught and learned a lot about being making remote teams work.

                    I've been working on all parts of the web-application stack, from hosting in Docker to data storage to API design to Ember on the front end. I've also been hacking the culture with <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a>, and spreading organizational, cultural, and technological wisdom by speaking at conferences.

                    GitHub had been on my I-need-to-work-here list since about 2009, and when I was offered a job there, I jumped at it. It was everything I had hoped for, and more.

                <p class="resume-item-copy">
                    This was where I found out what it is to be a citizen of the Internet in a real way. I traveled the world, speaking at conferences. I worked with some of my personal heroes. I was freed from having a commute. I learned what it was to help make a company.

                <p class="resume-item-copy">
                    My main focus was <a href="http://libgit2.github.com">libgit2</a>, an implementation of git with a nice API, and no dependencies on a UNIX environment. This led me to helping out with back-end systems, mainline git, and even the native clients (<a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>). I helped run an open-source project, wrote its documentation, and found out how I work best.

                    This is effectively <em>the book</em> on Git, and I was honored and excited when Scott asked me to co-author the second edition. It's now even better than it was when I read it as a younger engineer. The ability to help developers new and old become better at their craft is a point of pride for me, a strong reason why I do what I do.

                  I've written device drivers, cross-platform libraries, and GUI applications in C and C++. I've worked on production applications in C#, using both WPF for client-side apps and ASP.NET on the server. I've taught <a href="http://www.infiniteskills.com/training/porting-from-python-2-to-python-3.html">a course</a> on converting from Python 2 to Python 3. I've done user experience work on front-end web applications using Ember, Angular, Knockout and Vanilla.js.
